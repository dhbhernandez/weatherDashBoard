# Weather DashBoard
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own.
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.
My challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. 
The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions.
Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## What I've done: 
<ul>
<li>Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.</li>
<li>When searching for a city i am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.</li>
<li>When I view current weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.</li>
<li>When I view the UV index, then I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.</li>
<li>When I view future weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.</li>
<li>Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.</li>
<li>When I click on a city in the search history, then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city. When I open the weather dashboard, then I am presented with the last searched city forecast.</li>
</ul>
